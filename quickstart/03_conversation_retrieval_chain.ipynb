       " Document(page_content='inputs, and see what happens. At some point though, our application is performing\\nwell and we want to be more rigorous about testing changes. We can use a dataset\\nthat we‚Äôve constructed along the way (see above). Alternatively, we could spend some\\ntime constructing a small dataset by hand. For these situations, LangSmith simplifies\\ndataset uploading.Once we have a dataset, how can we use it to test changes to a prompt or chain? The most basic approach is to run the chain over the data points and visualize the outputs. Despite technological advancements, there still is no substitute for looking at outputs by eye. Currently, running the chain over the data points needs to be done client-side. The LangSmith client makes it easy to pull down a dataset and then run a chain over them, logging the results to a new project associated with the dataset. From there, you can review them. We\\'ve made it easy to assign feedback to runs and mark them as correct or incorrect directly in the web app, displaying aggregate statistics for each test project.We also make it easier to evaluate these runs. To that end, we\\'ve added a set of evaluators to the open-source LangChain library. These evaluators can be specified when initiating a test run and will evaluate the results once the test run completes. If we‚Äôre being honest, most of these evaluators aren\\'t perfect. We would not recommend that you trust them blindly. However, we do think they are useful for guiding your eye to examples you should look at. This becomes especially valuable as the number of data points increases and it becomes infeasible to look at each one manually.Human Evaluation\\u200bAutomatic evaluation metrics are helpful for getting consistent and scalable information about model behavior;\\nhowever, there is still no complete substitute for human review to get the utmost quality and reliability from your application.\\nLangSmith makes it easy to manually review and annotate runs through annotation queues.These queues allow you to select any runs based on criteria like model type or automatic evaluation scores, and queue them up for human review. As a reviewer, you can then quickly step through the runs, viewing the input, output, and any existing tags before adding your own feedback.We often use this for a couple of reasons:To assess subjective qualities that automatic evaluators struggle with, like creativity or humorTo sample and validate a subset of runs that were auto-evaluated, ensuring the automatic metrics are still reliable and capturing the right informationAll the annotations made using the queue are assigned as \"feedback\" to the source runs, so you can easily filter and analyze them later.', metadata={'source': 'https://docs.smith.langchain.com/overview', 'title': 'LangSmith Overview and User Guide | ü¶úÔ∏èüõ†Ô∏è LangSmith', 'description': 'Building reliable LLM applications can be challenging.

       "  Document(page_content='inputs, and see what happens. At some point though, our application is performing\\nwell and we want to be more rigorous about testing changes. We can use a dataset\\nthat we‚Äôve constructed along the way (see above). Alternatively, we could spend some\\ntime constructing a small dataset by hand. For these situations, LangSmith simplifies\\ndataset uploading.Once we have a dataset, how can we use it to test changes to a prompt or chain? The most basic approach is to run the chain over the data points and visualize the outputs. Despite technological advancements, there still is no substitute for looking at outputs by eye. Currently, running the chain over the data points needs to be done client-side. The LangSmith client makes it easy to pull down a dataset and then run a chain over them, logging the results to a new project associated with the dataset. From there, you can review them. We\\'ve made it easy to assign feedback to runs and mark them as correct or incorrect directly in the web app, displaying aggregate statistics for each test project.We also make it easier to evaluate these runs. To that end, we\\'ve added a set of evaluators to the open-source LangChain library. These evaluators can be specified when initiating a test run and will evaluate the results once the test run completes. If we‚Äôre being honest, most of these evaluators aren\\'t perfect. We would not recommend that you trust them blindly. However, we do think they are useful for guiding your eye to examples you should look at. This becomes especially valuable as the number of data points increases and it becomes infeasible to look at each one manually.Human Evaluation\\u200bAutomatic evaluation metrics are helpful for getting consistent and scalable information about model behavior;\\nhowever, there is still no complete substitute for human review to get the utmost quality and reliability from your application.\\nLangSmith makes it easy to manually review and annotate runs through annotation queues.These queues allow you to select any runs based on criteria like model type or automatic evaluation scores, and queue them up for human review. As a reviewer, you can then quickly step through the runs, viewing the input, output, and any existing tags before adding your own feedback.We often use this for a couple of reasons:To assess subjective qualities that automatic evaluators struggle with, like creativity or humorTo sample and validate a subset of runs that were auto-evaluated, ensuring the automatic metrics are still reliable and capturing the right informationAll the annotations made using the queue are assigned as \"feedback\" to the source runs, so you can easily filter and analyze them later.', metadata={'source': 'https://docs.smith.langchain.com/overview', 'title': 'LangSmith Overview and User Guide | ü¶úÔ∏èüõ†Ô∏è LangSmith', 'description': 'Building reliable LLM applications can be challenging.

       " 'answer': 'LangSmith provides several features that can help test and evaluate your LLM applications:\\n\\n1. **Tracing**: LangSmith traces all calls to LLMs, chains, agents, tools, and retrievers. This allows you to log and monitor the behavior of your application during testing.\\n\\n2. **Debugging**: LangSmith helps in debugging LLMs, chains, and agents by providing visibility into the exact inputs and outputs of LLM calls. You can easily understand the input data and identify any formatting issues or unexpected transformations. LangSmith also helps determine the exact output, which is useful for parsing structured representations.\\n\\n3. **Editing Prompts**: If you want to test how editing the prompt affects the output, LangSmith provides a playground feature. You can modify the prompt and re-run it in the playground to observe the resulting changes to the output. This feature currently supports OpenAI and Anthropic models for LLM and Chat Model calls.\\n\\n4. **Sequence of Events**: In complex chains and agents, it can be difficult to understand the sequence of events. LangSmith helps by providing visibility into the calls being made and the order in which they occur.\\n\\n5. **Dataset Testing**: LangSmith simplifies dataset uploading and testing. You can run a chain over a dataset and visualize the outputs. The LangSmith client makes it easy to pull down a dataset, run a chain over the data points, and log the results to a new project associated with the dataset. You can review the results, assign feedback to runs, and mark them as correct or incorrect.\\n\\n6. **Human Evaluation**: LangSmith allows for manual review and annotation of runs through annotation queues. You can select runs based on criteria like model type or automatic evaluation scores and queue them up for human review. Reviewers can quickly step through the runs, view the input and output, and provide their feedback. This is useful for assessing subjective qualities, validating auto-evaluated runs, and ensuring the quality and reliability of your application.\\n\\n7. **Monitoring**: LangSmith can also be used to monitor your application in production. You can log all traces, visualize latency and token usage statistics, and troubleshoot specific issues as they arise. You can also associate feedback programmatically with runs, track performance over time, and pinpoint underperforming data points.\\n\\n8. **Exporting Datasets**: LangSmith makes it easy to curate datasets for testing. These datasets can be exported for use in other contexts, such as OpenAI Evals or fine-tuning.\\n\\nOverall, LangSmith provides a range of tools and features to help test and evaluate your LLM applications, ensuring their reliability and performance.'}"
